# frontpage

This is a tiny repo for Momentum's frontpage site (momentum-mod.org).

For now we're entirely vanilla, using Vite for auto reloading and other goodies,
but should work fine without.

We use [Iconify](https://iconify.design/)'s
[web component](https://iconify.design/docs/iconify-icon/) for providing icons.

## Development

With Node installed, run `npm install`.

To launch a dev session with auto reloading, run `npm run dev`. Open the URL
Vite spits out and all should work.

For auto-formatting, run `npm run format`. I recommend the
[Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
to VSCode.
